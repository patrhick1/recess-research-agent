About Recess & How We Work with CPG Brands
Recess is a turnkey, scalable, and measurable brand activation platform that connects 
CPG brands to experiential sampling opportunities through a 3rd-party distribution 
network through trusted communities. We provide brands a tool to hyper-target their 
audiences by event types that include (coworking, fitness studios, college apartments, 
k-8 parent pickup, vacation rentals, holiday lights, haunted houses, malls like Tanger 
Outlets, endurance races, 5k races and runs, farmers markets, youth sports 
tournaments, PTO parent/teacher meeting, ski mountains, and more) and by retailer 
audiences by showing them which of our partners have the highest density of retail 
shoppers. We do not operate pop-up tours like a traditional experiential marketing 
agency. Instead, we leverage high-value community spaces and staff at trusted 
locations to distribute samples and engage with consumers. We currently have a 
partnership with Dollar General that allows brands that spend with Recess to count 
towards their Joint Business Proposal with Dollar General which opens up Recess as 
the first out-of-store retail media sampling unit. We are in discussions with Walmart and 
close to finalizing a similar deal as we have with Dollar General, so Dollar General 
Media Network and Walmart Connect are partners of Recess.

Our platform enables:
    ● Targeted distribution through geo-targeting, event-type targeting, and audience 
filters to reach ideal consumer as well as by providing the ability to focus on 
partners that over-index for certain retail audiences
    ● Access to a pre-vetted partner network, including coworking, fitness studios, 
college apartments, k-8 parent pickup, vacation rentals, holiday lights, haunted 
houses, malls like Tanger Outlets, endurance races, 5k races and runs, farmers 
markets, youth sports tournaments, PTO parent/teacher meeting, ski mountains, 
and more venues where on-site staff handle sample distribution.
    ● Seamless sampling execution at scale—staff members at these locations 
distribute samples directly to engaged consumers.
    ● Measurable ROI & Insights—we provide customers with data on consumer 
engagement, purchase intent, and campaign impact based on our sampling 
activations.
